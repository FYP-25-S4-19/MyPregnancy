    "content": "### The Three Trimesters\n\nPregnancy is typically divided into three trimesters, each lasting about 12-14 weeks. Understanding what happens during each stage can help you prepare for the changes ahead.\n\n#### 1. First Trimester (Weeks 1-12)\nThe first trimester involves significant development of the embryo. During this time:\n- The heart begins to beat.\n- Major organs and nervous system structures are formed.\n- You may experience early symptoms like morning sickness and fatigue.\n\n#### 2. Second Trimester (Weeks 13-26)\nOften called the \"honeymoon phase,\" the second trimester is when many women feel a surge of energy.\n- The baby's sex can often be determined via ultrasound.\n- You will likely begin to feel the baby move (quickening).\n- The baby begins to hear sounds and swallow.\n\n#### 3. Third Trimester (Weeks 27-40)\nThis is the final stretch where the baby grows rapidly to prepare for birth.\n- The baby gains significant weight and creates fat stores.\n- The lungs mature fully.\n- The baby usually moves into a head-down position."
